# Node git init cli

This cli uses the GitHub api and creates and pushes a git repository to GitHub with minimal effort.

## Install locally

To install locally, clone the repo and use npm to install

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/pruicr/node-git-init-cli.git
$ npm install -g
```

## Issues

There are several issues with the token and rsa key. I am working on getting those fixed.
